# Brainstorming: NOVEMBER 6, 2020

The project group had its very first meeting today. So far so good. I'm cautiously optimistic so far. I think it's safe to hope, without risk of too much heartache, that this group will work well together. We had a quick meet and greet, spoke a bit about backgrounds and ambition, went over what organizational tools we'll be using and had us a quick brainstorm.  

For the practical management of the project, we've set up the following tools:

| TOOL     | PURPOSE     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Slack | Used as the primary means of communication and documenting organizational documents and links. The intention is to organize the workspace to fully utilize the native functionality so that all discussions and comments easily can be transfered into course specific deliverables like the GDD |
| Discord | Primarily used as a video meeting and online pair programming tool. So we'll only be making use of the screen sharing and voice channel functionality. Tentatively, we will look into the possibility of perhaps migrating communication to discord completely to decrease the number of tools involved |
| Trello | Task organizing. We'll be devising some off brand variant of kanban as we work. We also spoke about giving one member the specific responsibility of policing the team so that everyone follows the appropriate Trello disciplines |
| Google Drive | Essentially only used for the actual GDD document |

<br>
Moving forwards, we need to look into finding the right tools for:

 * Game engine and logic
 * Art assets
 * Audio assets

That will be slightly dependent on the actual game idea however, which we also touched on this meeting. A couple of ideas where thrown into the mix today and personally I feel like some of them, one especially, can be really fun and is the excellent mix between interesting mechanics and feasible complexity that can make a project like this become really enjoyable. Cautiosly optimistic, like I said.

# GETTING MY BLOG ON: NOVEMBER 3, 2020

First entry in my second public online blog. Exciting. This series of entries will journal my work on the **DH2650 Game Design** course at KTH in the fall of 2020. Took the opportunity to use my personal Github page as a host since it will incentivize me to put some work into it, and make it look nicer. Prepare it for the future etc.  Right now, there's nothing here except this blog. None of the buttons work. No links are active. But at least I have a layout. Now all I need is a game idea. Good thing there are a few I made earlier.
